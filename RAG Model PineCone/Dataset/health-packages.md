## Health Packages
## Paalana Cares Your **Health & time **
“Health is more than freedom from illness and disease.” The chief goal of Health Check Up is to increase healthy life span of all in your family. Life styles are changing and so are the disease patterns. Stress, lack of exercise, unhealthy diet and work pressure make periodical check up a must. A timely detection can ensure you a long and healthy life ahead.
We have designed inclusive health Check Up packages for different age groups.
