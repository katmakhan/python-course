  * Hormone Assays – determines levels of specific hormones in biological samples aiding diagnosis and management of hormonal disorders as well as general endocrine function


  * Hematology


  * Complete Blood Count (CBC): A count and analysis of different blood cells types including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets that give an overall picture on health condition and detection of disease like anemia or leukemia.

  * Blood Typing & Crossmatching: This tells if the donor’s blood is compatible with the recipient’s thus preventing transfusion reactions
  * Blood Component Preparation: A separation process in which whole blood is processed into individual parts such as packed red cell masses, plasma, and platelets for transfusion purposes.


  * Microbiology


  * Culture and Sensitivity Tests: They are useful tests when it comes to identifying bacteria, fungi or viruses using patients’ samples such as blood, urine and sputum helping to determine the best antibiotics or antifungal drugs that can treat the infection.

  * Pap Smear Analysis: microscopic check up on cells from cervical smear to detect malignancy of the cervix or infections.
  * Fluid Cytology: diagnosing cancer, infections and so forth through evaluation of cells obtained from body fluids e.g pleural effusion or ascitic fluid.
